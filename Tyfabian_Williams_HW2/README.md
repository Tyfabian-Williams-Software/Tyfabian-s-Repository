All of the Zybooks were easy but I had trouble getting down how to tackle the Dates code.
My first commmit only had one input and i do not believe my comparison for the datetime is accurate.
The second commit I change the input to be a while of choice instead of the specific file stated in the assignment
The third commit had the input and output files as instuctructed but not sure as to if it works properly since i failed to test.
